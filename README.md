Someguy is an [HTTP Delegated Routing V1](https://specs.ipfs.tech/routing/http-routing-v1/) server that proxies requests to the [Amino DHT](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/glossary/#amino) and other Delegated Routing servers such as the [Network Indexer](https://cid.contact).

Someguy is also hosted as a [public utility](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/public-utilities/#delegated-routing-endpoint) at `https://delegated-ipfs.dev/routing/v1`.

go build -o someguy
```

```

See [`/docs/environment-variables.md`](./docs/environment-variables.md).

## Usage

You can use `someguy` as a client, or as a server.

### Server

You can start the server with `someguy start`. This will, by default, run a Delegated Routing V1 server that proxies requests to the [IPFS Amino DHT](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-09-amino-refactoring/) and the [cid.contact](https://cid.contact) indexer (IPNI) node.

For more details run `someguy start --help`.

### Client

If you don't want to run a server yourself, but want to query some other server, you can run `someguy ask` and choose any of the subcommands and ask for a provider, a peer, or even an IPNS record.

For more details run `someguy ask --help`.

### AutoConf

Someguy supports automatic configuration of bootstrap peers and delegated routing endpoints through the autoconf feature. When enabled (default), Someguy will fetch configuration from a remote URL and automatically expand the special `auto` placeholder value with network-appropriate defaults.

This feature can be configured via:
- `--autoconf` / `SOMEGUY_AUTOCONF`: Enable/disable autoconf (default: `true`)
- `--autoconf-url` / `SOMEGUY_AUTOCONF_URL`: URL to fetch configuration from (default: `https://conf.ipfs-mainnet.org/autoconf.json`)
- `--autoconf-refresh` / `SOMEGUY_AUTOCONF_REFRESH`: How often to refresh configuration (default: `24h`)

The `auto` placeholder can be used in:
- `--endpoing` / `SOMEGUY_DELEGATED_ENDPOINT`: the Delegated Routing V1 endpoint to ask

**Note:** When autoconf is disabled (`--autoconf=false`), using the `auto` placeholder will cause an error. You must provide explicit values for these configurations when autoconf is disabled.

## Deployment

Suggested method for self-hosting is to run a [prebuilt Docker image](#docker).

## Release

1. Create a PR from branch `release-vX.Y.Z` against `main` that:
   1. Tidies the [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) with the changes for the current release
   2. Updates the  [`version.json`](./version.json) file
2. Once the release checker creates a draft release, copy-paste the changelog into the draft
3. Merge the PR, the release will be automatically created once the PR is merged
