## [v0.11.0] - 2025-11-20

### Added

- Added support for [IPIP-476](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/476): `/routing/v1/peers/closest/{key}` endpoint for finding DHT-closest peers ([#124](https://github.com/ipfs/someguy/pull/124), [#127](https://github.com/ipfs/someguy/pull/127))
  - Returns DHT-closest peers to a given CID or PeerID
  - Accepts both CID and legacy PeerID formats (e.g., `12D3KooW...`)
  - Uses WAN DHT only for more reliable results
  - Includes cached addresses in results when available
  - Properly returns HTTP 500 when DHT is disabled
- AutoConf support: automatic configuration of bootstrap peers and delegated routing endpoints ([#123](https://github.com/ipfs/someguy/pull/123)). When enabled (default), the `auto` placeholder is replaced with network-recommended values.
  - All endpoint flags (`--provider-endpoints`, `--peer-endpoints`, `--ipns-endpoints`) default to `auto`
  - See [environment-variables.md](https://github.com/ipfs/someguy/blob/main/docs/environment-variables.md#someguy_autoconf) for configuration details

### Changed

- [go-libp2p v0.45.0](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/releases/tag/v0.45.0)
- [go-libp2p-kad-dht v0.35.1](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/releases/tag/v0.35.1)
- [boxo v0.35.2](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/releases/tag/v0.35.2)
- [go-log/v2 v2.9.0](https://github.com/ipfs/go-log/releases/tag/v2.9.0)

### Removed

### Fixed

- Fixed multiple race conditions and deadlocks in iterator implementations ([#119](https://github.com/ipfs/someguy/pull/119))

### Security

## [v0.10.0]

### Added

- Automatic generation of peer IDs for HTTP block providers when not explicitly configured ([#117](https://github.com/ipfs/someguy/pull/117))
  - When `SOMEGUY_HTTP_BLOCK_PROVIDER_ENDPOINTS` are configured but no `SOMEGUY_HTTP_BLOCK_PROVIDER_PEERIDS` are configured, synthetic PeerIDs will now be autogenerated. These are deterministic placeholders derived from endpoint URLs, used only for routing system compatibility with HTTP-based trustless gateways - no libp2p cryptographic operations are performed with these IDs

### Changed

- Modernized Docker build configuration ([#118](https://github.com/ipfs/someguy/pull/118))
- Updated to Go 1.24/1.25 ([#115](https://github.com/ipfs/someguy/pull/115), [#118](https://github.com/ipfs/someguy/pull/118))

## [v0.9.1]

### Added

- Added exporting of routing http client metrics: the endpoint will now include `someguy_routing_http_client_*` metrics when delegated routing clients are used:
  - Histogram: the latency of operations by the routing HTTP client
    - `someguy_routing_http_client_latency_bucket{code,error,host,operation,le}`
    - `someguy_routing_http_client_latency_sum{code,error,host,operation}`
    - `someguy_routing_http_client_latency_count{code,error,host,operation}`
  - Histogram: the number of elements in a response collection
    - `someguy_routing_http_client_length_bucket{host,operation,le}`
    - `someguy_routing_http_client_length_sum{host,operation}`
    - `someguy_routing_http_client_length_count{host,operation}`
  - See [docs/metrics.md](https://github.com/ipfs/someguy/blob/main/docs/metrics.md) for more details.

## [v0.9.0]

### Added

- Added `http-block-provider-endpoints` and `http-block-provider-peerids` options to enable using a [trustless HTTP gateway](https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/trustless-gateway/) as a source for synthetic content routing records.
  - When the configured gateway responds with HTTP 200 to an HTTP HEAD request for a block (`HEAD /ipfs/{cid}?format=raw`), `FindProviders` returns a provider record containing a predefined PeerID and the HTTP gateway as a multiaddr with `/tls/http` suffix.

### Changed

- `accelerated-dht` option was removed and replaced with a `dht` option which enables toggling between the standard client, accelerated client and being disabled
- [boxo v0.30.0](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/releases/tag/v0.30.0)
- [go-libp2p v0.41.1](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/releases/tag/v0.41.1)
- [go-libp2p-kad-dht v0.32.0](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/releases/tag/v0.32.0)

## [v0.8.1]

This release includes a number of dependency updates that include bug fixes and improvements.

### Changed

- [go-libp2p 0.41.0](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/releases/tag/v0.41.0)
- [go-libp2p-kad-dht v0.30.0](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/releases/tag/v0.30.0)
- [Boxo v0.28.0](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/releases/tag/v0.28.0)

## [v0.8.0]

### Added

- Enabled CORS for PUT requests to `/routing/v1/ipns`.

## [v0.7.1]

### Fixed

- Fix a bug whereby, cached peers with private multiaddrs were returned in `/routing/v1/providers` responses, as they were not passing through `sanitizeRouter`.

## [v0.7.0]

### Added

- Peer addresses are cached for 48h to match [provider record expiration on Amino DHT](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/blob/v0.28.1/amino/defaults.go#L40-L43).
- In the background, someguy probes cached peers at most once per hour (`PeerProbeThreshold`) by attempting to dial them to keep their multiaddrs up to date. If a peer is not reachable, an exponential backoff is applied to reduce the frequency of probing. If a cached peer is unreachable for more than 48h (`MaxBackoffDuration`), it is removed from the cache.
- Someguy now augments providers missing addresses in `FindProviders` with cached addresses. If a peer is encountered with no cached addresses, `FindPeer` is dispatched in the background and the result is streamed in the reponse. Providers for which no addresses can be found, are omitted from the response.
  - This can be enabled via `SOMEGUY_CACHED_ADDR_BOOK=true|false` (enabled by default)
  - Two additional configuration options for the  `cachedAddrBook` implementation:
    - `SOMEGUY_CACHED_ADDR_BOOK_ACTIVE_PROBING` whether to actively probe cached peers in the background to keep their multiaddrs up to date.
    - `SOMEGUY_CACHED_ADDR_BOOK_RECENT_TTL` to adjust the TTL for cached addresses of recently connected peers.

## [v0.6.0]

### Added

- Add request tracing with sampling or require token for requests with Traceparent header. See [tracing.md](./docs/tracing.md) for more details.

### Changed

- go-libp2p-kad-dht updated to [v0.28.1](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/releases/tag/v0.28.1)
- Metrics `someguy_http_request_duration_seconds` and `someguy_http_response_size_bytes` were replaced with  `delegated_routing_server_http_request_duration_seconds` and `delegated_routing_server_http_response_size_bytes` from upstream `boxo/routing/http/server`.

## [v0.4.1]

### Added

- `SOMEGUY_LIBP2P_LISTEN_ADDRS` config [environment variable](./docs/environment-variables.md#someguy_libp2p_listen_addrs) for customizing the interfaces, ports, and transports of the libp2p host created by someguy. [#79](https://github.com/ipfs/someguy/pull/79)

## [v0.2.2]

### Fixed

- The `/routing/v1/peers` endpoint correctly filters out private addresses.

## [v0.2.1]

### Fixed

- Upgraded Boxo with fix to ensure that `/routing/v1/peers` endpoint accepts all variants of Peer IDs that are seen in the wild.
